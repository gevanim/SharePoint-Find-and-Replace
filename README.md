# SharePoint-Find-and-Replace-for-SharePoint-2007
SharePoint Search and Replace replaces hardcoded strings in SharePoint lists, document libraries, web part properties and text-based documents in SharePoint 2007 server. SharePoint administrators will find this useful during SharePoint upgrade process when user hardcoded URLs result in broken links due to server name changes.

## Tool info
ou are no doubt aware that during the process of implementing SharePoint-based solutions, configuration changes often lead to a situation where hardcoded strings in the SharePoint information store are either not updated anymore, or even worse: they are simply wrong, pointing the user to a wrong location. For example, a "Favorites" links list item that directs users to "http://intranet/site" now needs to be changed to "http://extranet/site".

KWizCom's SharePoint List String Search and Replace will scan all of your SharePoint lists, WebParts and text documents and will replace the existing strings with an updated string of your choosing.

We are pleased to share this utility with the SharePoint community, and trust that it will help reduce SharePoint upgrade challenges.
